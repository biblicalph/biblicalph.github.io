### Why I Started This Blog
Hi there! I'm Kwabena Boadu. I'm a software engineer and life-long learner. When I'm not working, I love to workout, play football games and watch/play football and basketball, among other things.

I don't write much - I have just about 3 articles in the past 5 years. Over the course of this period (the past 5 years), however, I have benefited from the knowledge of others through writings and video recordings. I have also acquired a lot of knowledge that I could and should have shared for the benefit of others. 

I am looking to change this trend and this is why I started this blog. For starters, I am committing to writing at least an article each month. My writings will mostly share things I'm learning, challenges I am or have faced, and hopefully, how I have or will solve them. 

I have no idea how it's going to pan out, but I'm highly excited to get started anyway. As Steve Jobs famously said:
> the journey is the reward

Come along. I'll be happy to share your company as I embark on this journey. Thanks for offering to be there. See you again soon.
