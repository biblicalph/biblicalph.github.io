Setting Up CircleCI CLI
Command line interface that can be used locally from a terminal. 
We'll be using it primarily to:
1. Debug and validate the CI config
2. Run jobs locally

To install, visit [https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/local-cli/){:target="_blank"}

To validate a config, run `circleci validate <path-to-config>`
If `<path-to-config>` is omitted, the CLI will look for a config file in `.circleci` 
directory in the current directory.

To run jobs locally, you need to setup an access token that will be used by the CLI 
to access builds.
To generate an access token, login to CircleCI and visit [https://circleci.com/account/api](https://circleci.com/account/api){:target="_blank"}

Next setup the CLI to use the access token - `circleci setup`.
Paste your personal access token and accept the default CircleCI host

Install docker - a requirement for running local jobs.
To run builds locally, run `circleci local execute --job <name-of-job>`

As of this writing, the CLI allows you to run a single job at a time using docker.
