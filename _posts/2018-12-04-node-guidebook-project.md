In September of 2018, I started mentoring a junior developer to build a NodeJS API using [Express framework](https://expressjs.com). Among other things, my mentee struggled with defining the project structure, testing (unit versus integration) and managing configuration.

While helping him resolve some of these challenges, it hit me to build a NodeJS API project that teaches some of these fundamentals. I decided to call this project [Node Guidebook](https://github.com/biblicalph/guidebook).

The aim of the project is to teach, via a fully working sample example, how to build a NodeJS production ready API. The project covers among other things:

* Project structure
* Configuration management
* Testing - unit and integration
* Error handling
* Continuous integration
* Docker for local app development

I'm happy to hear your thoughts, suggestions, opinions and critiques of this project with the sole aim of putting out work of very high standards from which others can learn.
